					<p>
						UMA is a building block for the financial innovation that’s made possible by permissionless, public blockchains, like Ethereum. Using concepts borrowed from traditional financial derivatives, UMA defines an open-source protocol to allow any two counterparties to design and create their own financial contracts. But unlike traditional derivatives, UMA contracts are secured with economic incentives alone, making them self-enforcing and universally accessible.

									A Custom, 2-Party Agreement
								</h5>

								<p>
									Bob and Jane want to make a contract on the price of apples over the next six months (currently trading at $3/lb). Jane thinks it will go down and wants to short. Bob thinks it will go up, so he’ll go long. They can draft a contract between the two of them, no third-party neccessary.

									<strong>2:</strong>
									Automatic Margin Coverage
								</h5>

								<p>
									Over the next six months the price of apples shifts up and down (but mostly down). As the price shifts down (verified by UMA’s Oracle), Bob automatically contributes money to cover the margin. The more it shifts down the more he contributes.

								<h5>
									<strong>3:</strong>
									Instant Enforcement & Acceptance
								</h5>

								<p>
									After six months, the price of apples has fallen to $2/lb. Jane’s bet was right. Because the Bob was consistently contributing funds to cover the margin, the contract is instantly enforced, Jane sees a nice return, and both Jane and Bob trust and accept the conclusion.

					We believe deeply that financial markets should be universally accessible and open, a vision we believe to be shared by financial regulators globally. The potential of decentralized, open, finance is truly exciting provided that regional laws and regulations protecting consumers are respected.
